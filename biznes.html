      <h2>ðŸ‘¥ Target Audience</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Primary:</strong> First-year students (both Slovak and international) at all UPJÅ  faculties.<br>

      <h2>ðŸ“Š Market Analysis and Competition</h2>
      <p>
        There are some existing alternatives, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Web pages of individual faculties,</li>
        <li>Facebook groups for freshmen,</li>
        <li>Student portals (e.g., ISIC, UNIZA Help).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, none of these offer a <strong>centralized, interactive and unofficial</strong> platform created directly <strong>by students for students at UPJÅ </strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The competition is low to medium, which creates a strong potential for growth, collaboration, and long-term development of the portal.

      <h2>ðŸ“¢ Promotion and Sustainability</h2>
      <p>
        The portal will be promoted through social media channels (Instagram, Facebook), university groups, and recommendations from older students.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project has the potential to become the main unofficial information hub for UPJÅ  students and can be sustainably maintained through cooperation with new student cohorts from the IT faculty and beyond.
